* Cryptocurrency blockchain

- consists of blocks
- each block contains at least one transaction
- transaction is a list on inputs and outputs
- output is an amount of coins and script with rules
- input is a pointer to output and script

* Cryptocurrency storage

Any blockchain system should have identifiers to send/receive coins.

Those identifiers are usually called addresses.

Address is generated from user's public key.

* Bitcoin address

It is more likely that the Earth is destroyed in the next 5 seconds, than that a collision occur in the next millenium.

- P2PKH - Pay To Public Key Hash
- P2PK - Pay To Public Key
- P2SH - Pay To Script Hash

* Safety issue

To store & use Bitcoins one should store & use private keys safely.

_Wallet_ - software for storing & managing keys with friendly UI.

Types of wallets:

- hot - online keys storage, easy and not safe
- cold - offline storage, inconvenient yet safe

* Key management strategy

- generate keys for hot & cold storage
- too many coins in hot? send to cold address
- not enough in hot? put cold key pair into hot wallet

A set of key pairs is usually generated.

It is common to set up _deterministic_ wallets â€“ a single seed is used to generate all the keys.

* Multisignatures

In Bitcoin script can be specified as recipient (P2SH).

That is how extra rules on transaction may be added.

Example: this bitcoins may be spent by anyone who provides at least 2 valid signatures for the following public keys: {PK1, PK2, PK3}

As a result:

- responsibility distribution
- increased security
- multifactor transaction signing

* Processing

* Cryptocurrency exchange

- accept cryptocurrency and fiat
- on demand fund return
- fiat to cryptocurrency exchange and vice versa

Note: cryptocurrency operations are not always included into blockchain. Some of them are exchange local.

Exchanges connect cryptocurrency with world economics.

Problem: third-party player trust.

* Proof of reserves

Exchanges are subject to regular bank regulations.

The major part of fund is placed in cold storage.

In hot storage - daily turnover only.

One can request proof of reserves: exchange will proof its opulence with special signature.
