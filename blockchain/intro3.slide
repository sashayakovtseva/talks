* Centralized systems

- cheap (no extra costs to maintain security)
- efficient
- easy to use (often support team available)

* Decentralized systems

- expensive
- slow (scaling issues)
- complex

Absolutely decentralized systems are Utopia.

* Bitcoin system

Decentralized due to system specification and economical motivation

Consists of:

- P2P network â€“ anyone can join, decentralized
- mining - theoretically decentralized
- software - centralized

* Blockchain consensus

* Problem

- who maintains blockchain?
- who validates transactions?
- who creates new coins?
- who specifies rules?
- who measures coins value?

How to create *decentralized* system that answers all this questions?

* Consensus definition

N nodes, k < N - unavailable or villain.

Nodes suggest some data to meet the consensus about.

Consensus algorithm result:

- a single value among all suggestions is chosen
- a chosen value is suggested by a valid node

It was believed that consensus can't be reached in decentralized system.

Until...

* Bitcoin consensus

- nodes are motivated to play according to the rules
- eventual consistency (avg. 6 blocks to be sure)

Assume > 50% of nodes are fair players. The idea is:

- random node is chosen to propose next block
- if block is valid others include it into their local blockchain
- otherwise block is ignored

* The algorithm

- new transaction is spread among all nodes
- each node builds new block
- random node publishes block
- others accept it if its valid and use its hash for next blocks

Every transaction is signed so attacker cannot use others coins.

* Possible attack
